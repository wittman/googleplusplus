# GooglePlusPlus

The googleplusplus userscript changes appearance of Google Plus by hiding left and right side bars and widening main content containers.

So far, this userscript was tested in Google Chrome 12 and Firefox 5 (on OS X).

This is experimental, alpha quality code. Depending on the activity/navigation withint Google+, you have to refresh the browser for the script to re-format the page properly.

Feedback is welcome.
